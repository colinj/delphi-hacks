============
A collection of hacks, demos and experimental code for my musing.


EventAggregator
---------------
A simple demo created for my Sydney ADUG presentation (April 2011) on the EventAggregator pattern.

ObjectFactory
-------------
A demo application to create dynamic objects using the Factory pattern. This demo does not use generics.

OpenClosedPrinciple
-------------------
A sample application to demonstrate the Open-Closed Principle. By following the change commits for this sample application, you can see the code changes that turn an application that violates the Open-Closed Principle to one that adopts it.
